Don't expect *too much* intelligent stuff here XD

I like programming, music, grilled cheese sandwiches, newspaper comics, and old 1900s cartoons (Tom and Jerry is my favorite). Topics I really enjoy are cryptography, data structures, programming languages, and low-level systems programming.

My actual professional stuff is linked in the ["About Me" tab]("/about.md")
